Organization:
- Refactor main.go structure
  - Check a real echo application for reference on organization
  - Move things to separate files
  - Add request state struct

- Setup proper slog logging
- Understand why echo prints json in command line logging
- Log execution of programs to temporary files (based on debug environment variable)

- Move cli to separate project (or remove it altogether)

Documentation:

- Document websocket protocol
- Link to frontend repo's on backend's README.md
- Document frontend README.md

Structure:
- Implement work queue
- Implement youtube video cache
- Increase frontend margin top and max-width a little bit

Robustness:
- Check if given youtube link is actually a watch? link in backend, and extract watch part
  for yt-dlp
- Check length of youtube video before trying to download it
- Reject non watch? videos on frontend
- Check if video is mp4 before running
- Cache youtube videos locally
- Show error messages/status to user in frontend
- Apply CORS in general
- Apply CORS in WebSocket requests

Nice to have:
- Replace python locate script with pure go implementation

Features:
- Add rating feature, so users can rate the results they got
- Add
- Implement frontend reporting of errors when the backend fails
