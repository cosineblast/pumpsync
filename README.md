Pump it Up players often record their gameplays for various reasons. 

However, because the gameplay is often record in public arcades, it can be hard to listen to the music
being played in the recordings.

On top of that, it is common for players to overlay a video of charting of the song being played, to 
make it easier to follow the movements of the gameplay. 

pumpsync is a project intended to help people with that.

TODO: document what pumpsync can do and how it works.
